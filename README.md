## Grocery App Shared DTO

This repository contains shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used by both the grocery app and the grocery app server. The DTOs help in increasing reusability and reducing repeated code across the projects.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to maintain a consistent set of data structures for communication between the client (grocery app) and the server (grocery app server). By centralizing the DTOs, we ensure that any changes to data models are reflected across all connected projects.

## Features

- **Reusability:** Shared DTOs eliminate the need to duplicate code in multiple projects.
- **Consistency:** Ensures data structures remain consistent between client and server.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized management of DTOs simplifies updates and modifications.
